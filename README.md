# terminal_ytm
A small, elementary youtube music client for the terminal.
I got tired of silence, outside of my graphical sessions.
This uses an unofficial python youtube music api, as well as the mpv python module to support playback.
Right now, you will need to provide your own oauth.json.
As expected, no warrenty or guarentees on this.
## TODO
Better readme
Allow more than just song searching
Allow user input to control playback
Clean up stored API responses
Unauthorized clients
